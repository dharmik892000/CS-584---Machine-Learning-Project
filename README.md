Machine Learning Project on Telecom Churn Prediction

** Repo Consists of Files for Telecom Churn Prediction.


In this Project, we explored the Telecommunication Churn Prediction, where we started by analyzing the dataset, then performing Feature Engineering, and lastly comparison of three learning models to see which is the best fit for the dataset in terms of accuracy.
• Models used were Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG-Boost out of three models XG-Boost outperformed others with Accuracy of 85.2 percentage, F1 Score of 85.3 percentage, and precision of 85.4 percentage and recall of 85.2 percentage. ROC curve illustrated that the XG-Boost has the highest AUC value of 0.92, which has a strong ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.
• Error Analysis revealed that all the models showcased the similar patterns of errors, which suggests that the model may benefit from tuning or extra features o improve the accuracy for the customer segments.
• To Conclude, we can state that the XG-Boost Model showed better performance, which helped for churn prediction in telecommunication industry, and further it can be optimized to provide the valuable insights for Customer Retention Strategies.
